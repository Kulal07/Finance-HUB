### Plan for Deployment

1. **Build the Application**:
   - Run the command `npm run build` to compile the application for production. This will generate the necessary files in the `.next` directory.

2. **Start the Application**:
   - After building, run the command `npm start` to start the production server. This will serve the application on the specified port.

3. **Verify Configuration**:
   - Ensure that the `next.config.mjs` file is set up correctly for production, including optimizations for images and any experimental features that may affect stability.

4. **Check TypeScript Settings**:
   - Review the `tsconfig.json` settings to ensure that strict mode is enabled and that the application is set to compile correctly.

5. **Test the Application**:
   - After starting the application, test the deployed version to ensure that all features are functioning as expected.

6. **Monitor Logs**:
   - Keep an eye on the server logs for any errors or warnings that may arise during the deployment process.

### Follow-Up Steps
- If any issues arise during the deployment, address them based on the error messages or logs.
- Consider optimizing the application further based on performance metrics after deployment.
